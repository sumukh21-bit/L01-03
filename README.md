# Lab 01–03 — Memory Match (Starter Code)

This starter package supports Labs 01–03 for **CSCI3230U Web App Development**.

You will build a two-page web app:

- `memory_match.html` — the game page
- `high_scores.html` — the high scores page

Over three labs you will add:

- **Lab 01:** HTML structure and content
- **Lab 02:** Styling with Bulma + custom CSS (responsive layout)
- **Lab 03:** JavaScript logic (dynamic board, events, dynamic scores table)

## Directory Structure

L01-03/
├─ README.md
└─ src/
   ├─ pages/
   │  ├─ memory_match.html
   │  └─ high_scores.html
   ├─ css/
   │  └─ memory_match.css
   └─ js/
      ├─ memory_match.js
      └─ high_scores.js

---

## How to Run

Open the game page in your browser:

- `src/pages/memory_match.html`

If links are correct, the page will load:

- `../css/memory_match.css`
- `../js/memory_match.js`

Open the high scores page:

- `src/pages/high_scores.html`

## Notes

- If you see missing script/style errors, check your relative paths from `src/pages/`.
- If you use features like `fetch()` later, you may need to run a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).
